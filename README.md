# Toggle

## What is it?

It's a library that contains a blog 'model' and a set of gulp helpers to assist generating a static blog. It's what's currently powering my blog [staxmanade.com](http://staxmanade.com).

## Why not use another static blog generator?

I should have :) - but I wanted to learn [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com) and just hack on something.

# Why does your site looks just like an [Octopress](http://octopress.org) site?

I wrote a series on how to migrate from Blogspot to Octopres and then struggled to [get my series](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/2226) to look the way I wanted and quickly found myself wanting to hack on something (not in Ruby). So I ported my OctoPress site to a static nodejs generated site leveraging Gulp and this set of libraries grew out of it.

# Can I use it?

Of course (that's why it's out here) - but I can't say I know the future of it at this point. I will probably hack on it once in a while. Free to start up a [converstaion in the isssues](https://github.com/togglejs/toggle/issues).
