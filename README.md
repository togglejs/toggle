# Toggle (tog)

## What is it?

It's a library of node/javascript helpers and series of [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) plugins, and a command line tool (`tog`) that help generating and publishing a static blog. It's what's currently powering my blog/site [staxmanade.com](http://staxmanade.com).

## Why not use another static blog generator?

I should have :) - but wanted to learn [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com) and [just hack on something](http://staxmanade.com/2015/03/custom-static-blog-generator---no-longer-using-octopress/).

# Why does your site look just like an [Octopress](http://octopress.org) site?

I wrote a series on how to [migrate from Blogspot to Octopress](http://staxmanade.com/2014/04/migrating-blogspot-to-octopress-part-1-introduction/) and then struggled to [get my series](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/2226) to render the way I wanted using Jekyll/Octopress and quickly found myself wanting to hack on something (not in Ruby). So I [ported my blog yet-again](http://staxmanade.com/2015/03/custom-static-blog-generator---no-longer-using-octopress/) from OctoPress to a static nodejs generated site leveraging Gulp and this tool-set grew out of it.

# Can I use it?

**I dare you...** I can't say I know the future of it at this point, but I'm quite liking it so far.

I need to create a sample `gulpfile.js` to show how I use it to generate my blog.
